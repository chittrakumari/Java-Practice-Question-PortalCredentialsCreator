# Java-Practice-Question-PortalCredentialsCreator

This repository contains a practice question.

Q.Create a java class file called Student.java. The Student.java
class should contain the following members:

        1. a private field to store the class roll number of a student,
        as a primitive byte type value.
        
        2. a private field to store the first name of a student, as a
        reference String type value. This should be immutable!
        
        3. a private field to store the last name of a student, as a
        reference String type value. This should be immutable!
        
        4. a private field to store the current year of a student, as a
        primitive byte type value.
        
        5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields,
        at least two constructors for this class, the equals(),
        toString() and the hashCode() methods.
        
Create a java class file called PortalCredentialsCreator.java. The
class should contain the following two methods:

       1. public List<UserName> createListOfUserNames(List<Student>
         studentsList) {}
         
       This method inputs a list of Student type defined above, and
       creates a list of UserName type. Create a java class file
       called UserName.java and create a private field called
        userName, to store the user name of a student as a reference
       String value. No two user names in the list should be the
       same.
